# The Design Preview as Seen on Dribbble
![Design preview I worked on by Fiorella Guayama](./readme/fiorella-guayama-design.png)

This is the development of a one-page quiz landing page as designed by [Fiorella Guayama](https://dribbble.com/shots/7434980-Landing-Quiz) on Dribbble. 

I had access only to the shot in JPEG format. I got all dimensions and color codes from the image using Adobe Illustrator. Their values may be inaccurate compared to what Fiorella designed but they're very close. With Illustrator, I redesigned her funny logo ðŸ˜„ and the white checkmark.

## Overview

### The Challenge

As a user, you should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size `(Still working on this)` **Update** `(Milestone Achieved!)`
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

Here're the screenshots of my development:

- Netlify URL: [quiz-landing-page-fiorella.netlify.app](https://quiz-landing-page-fiorella.netlify.app/)


## The Development Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Animation
- CSS Variables
- Complex CSS gradients manipulation
- Media Query `(Still working on this)` **Update** `(Milestone Achieved!)`

### Cool Stuff I learned

The newest and coolest stuff I learned working on this project is `coding of doughnut pie chart` and the `display: inline-grid` CSS property.


### Future Development

I couldn't add the polygon graphics on the background of the design with code. I could have created it with Illustrator and glue it to the background using css `background-image` property but I want to it using code - probably with the combination of CSS, Javascript, and SVG; I'm not so sure what tech stack that would require. I'll know when I get there.
